# Changelog

## Node.js Command Execution System Refactoring - Round 2

### Further Simplifications
- Removed NodeCommandType enum and related code, simplifying validation logic
- Eliminated redundant tool-specific functions in Rust backend
- Implemented function factories in TypeScript to reduce code duplication
- Made it easier to extend with new tools through factories
- Exposed factory functions in the public API for customization

### Code Structure Improvements
- Reduced TypeScript code length by ~50% while maintaining same API surface
- Simplified command validation logic in Rust
- Improved maintainability with more focused code

## Node.js Command Execution System Refactoring - Round 1

### Security Improvements
- Added enhanced command validation in Rust to check for dangerous patterns
- Updated command regex validation in capabilities to be more restrictive
- Implemented proper security checks at multiple levels (TypeScript, Rust, Tauri capabilities)

### Code Structure Improvements
- Consolidated redundant files (`node-commands.ts` and `nodejs-executor.ts`) into a single `nodejs.ts` module
- Applied DRY principle to Rust command execution with shared validation and preparation functions
- Simplified command execution logic with better error handling
- Removed redundant tool-specific functions in favor of a more agnostic approach

### API Improvements
- Created a unified, streamlined API with consistent naming
- Added better type definitions and documentation
- Improved resource cleanup mechanisms
- Enhanced event handling with more robust error handling

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive README files for both frontend and backend components
- Provided clear examples for all API usage patterns
- Documented security considerations and configuration requirements

### Removed Deprecated Code
- Removed deprecated NodeCommandType enum in favor of simple string commands
- Cleaned up unnecessary command wrapper functions
- Eliminated framework-specific command handlers

This refactoring improves security, reduces code duplication, and provides a more robust and developer-friendly API for executing Node.js commands from a Tauri application.
