# Node.js Sidecar Implementation Improvements

## Overview

We've enhanced the Node.js sidecar implementation for the Tauri application with several key improvements focused on security, performance, and developer experience. These updates make the sidecar more robust, secure, and easier to use for various Node.js command execution needs.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Security Configuration

- **Tightened Security Scope**: Updated the Tauri configuration to restrict allowed commands to specific Node.js tools (npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, node) with a proper scope configuration following Tauri's security best practices.
- **Command Validation**: Added validation to ensure only whitelisted commands can be executed.

### 2. Real-time Command Streaming

- **Streaming API**: Added a new streaming API that provides real-time output from Node.js commands, essential for long-running operations like framework installations.
- **Event-based Architecture**: Implemented an event-based system for streaming command output that cleanly separates concerns and provides type safety.
- **Resource Management**: Added proper cleanup of event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

### 3. Improved Frontend Integration

- **TypeScript API**: Extended the TypeScript wrapper with streaming variants of all command functions (`npmStreaming`, `npxStreaming`, etc.).
- **React Component**: Created a reusable React component (`NodeCommandExecutor`) that demonstrates the streaming API with a clean, interactive UI.
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type definitions for better developer experience and error prevention.

### 4. Framework Task Integration

- **Unified Execution Model**: Refactored the framework task implementation to exclusively use the Node.js sidecar for all framework types, eliminating duplicated command execution logic.
- **Enhanced Next.js Setup**: Updated the Next.js framework setup process to use the streaming API for better progress reporting.
- **Event Forwarding**: Implemented event forwarding from command output to the application's logging system.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for more informative error messages.

## Technical Details

### Streaming Implementation

The streaming implementation uses Tauri's event system to provide real-time updates:

1. **Backend (Rust)**:
   - `execute_node_command_streaming`: Spawns a command and streams output events
   - `NodeCommandEvent`: Enum with variants for different event types (Stdout, Stderr, Completed, Error)
   - Event emission using a unique channel per command execution

2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**:
   - `runNodeCommandStreaming`: Wraps the Rust function and handles event subscription/unsubscription
   - `NodeCommandListener`: Type for callback functions processing command events
   - Utility functions for common tools (npm, npx, yarn, pnpm)

### Unified Command Execution

The new implementation:
- Uses a single execution strategy for all framework setup operations
- Eliminates complex path resolution for finding executables like npx
- Reduces code duplication and complexity
- Ensures consistent error handling and output streaming across all Node.js command executions

## Security Considerations

The implementation follows several security best practices:

1. **Command Restriction**: Only allows specific Node.js-related commands to be executed
2. **Working Directory Validation**: Ensures commands are executed in the intended directories
3. **Input Sanitization**: Validates all inputs before executing commands
4. **Event Isolation**: Uses unique event channels for each command execution to prevent cross-talk

## Usage Examples

### Basic Command Execution
```typescript
import { npm } from '@/lib/nodejs';

const result = await npm('/path/to/project', 'install lodash');
console.log(`Success: ${result.success}, Output: ${result.stdout}`);
```

### Streaming Command Execution
```typescript
import { npmStreaming } from '@/lib/nodejs';

await npmStreaming('/path/to/project', 'install react', (event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'stdout':
      updateProgressUI(event.data);
      break;
    case 'stderr':
      showErrorMessage(event.data);
      break;
    case 'completed':
      finishInstallation(event.success);
      break;
  }
});
```

## React Component Usage
```jsx
import NodeCommandExecutor from '@/components/NodeCommandExecutor';

function DependencyInstaller() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Install Project Dependencies</h2>
      <NodeCommandExecutor 
        workingDir="/path/to/project" 
        initialCommand="npm install" 
        autoStart={true} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Command Cancellation**: Add ability to cancel long-running commands
2. **Progress Estimation**: Implement smarter progress estimation for certain command types
3. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently executed commands to improve performance
4. **Command Batching**: Support running multiple commands in sequence
5. **Error Recovery**: Add automatic retry logic for common transient errors
